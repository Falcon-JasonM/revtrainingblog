<body>
    The first thing you will need to do to take your website live after you've built it is to get a static IP <address class=""></address>
    <ul>
        <li>The address you get from your internet provider is <i>dynamic</i>, and changes.</li>
        <li>If you want people to be able to find their way to your site, it has to 'live' at a fixed, or <i>static</i> address.</li>
        <li>You can get a free static web address from <a href="https://www.noip.com/" target="_blank"> NoIP.com</a></li>
        <li>You will need to set up <b>port forwarding</b> on your local router for this to work.<br>
            Exact procedure depends on your ISP and router model.<br>
            Suggest googling it for instructions.</li>

    </ul>
